# Patatap-Clone

Clone of Patatap App that uses [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) and [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) libraries to practice keydown and keyup events.

# The Project

Coding with Colt Steele, this project is based off the awesome [Patatap](https://patatap.com/) website and was used to align keydown and keyup events with animations and sounds.
